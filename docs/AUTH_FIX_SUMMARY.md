# Auth & Persistence Fix Summary

## Problems Identified

Your GoodEats app had several critical authentication and persistence issues:

### 1. **No Session Persistence** ‚ùå
The main Supabase client (`/lib/supabase.ts`) wasn't configured with localStorage for auth sessions. The `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr` doesn't automatically set up session persistence like the old SDK did - you need to explicitly configure it.

**Result**: Sessions weren't persisting across page reloads, causing users to appear logged out.

### 2. **Calendar Page Race Condition** ‚ùå
The calendar page was trying to fetch events before the user data was loaded. `getCurrentUser()` and `fetchEvents()` were called in parallel, but `fetchEvents` would immediately return if `currentUser` wasn't set yet.

**Result**: Calendar showed no events even after successful login.

### 3. **Potential Trigger Issues** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Your database has a trigger (`handle_new_user()`) that should automatically create user profiles, but username and full_name weren't being stored properly.

**Result**: User profiles existed but were missing critical data.

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: Added Session Persistence to Supabase Client

**File**: `/lib/supabase.ts`

Added explicit localStorage configuration to persist auth sessions:

```typescript
export const supabase = createBrowserClient<Database>(
  supabaseUrl,
  supabaseAnonKey,
  {
    auth: {
      persistSession: true,        // Enable session persistence
      autoRefreshToken: true,      // Auto-refresh tokens
      detectSessionInUrl: true,    // Handle email confirmation links
      storage: {                   // Configure localStorage
        getItem: (key: string) => {
          if (typeof window === 'undefined') return null
          return window.localStorage.getItem(key)
        },
        setItem: (key: string, value: string) => {
          if (typeof window === 'undefined') return
          window.localStorage.setItem(key, value)
        },
        removeItem: (key: string) => {
          if (typeof window === 'undefined') return
          window.localStorage.removeItem(key)
        }
      }
    }
  }
)
```

### ‚úÖ Fix 2: Fixed Calendar Page Race Condition

**File**: `/app/calendar/page.tsx`

Changed the useEffect to properly await user data before fetching events:

```typescript
// Before (BAD):
useEffect(() => {
  getCurrentUser()  // Async, returns immediately
  fetchEvents()     // Runs before user is set!
}, [currentDate])

// After (GOOD):
useEffect(() => {
  const loadUserAndEvents = async () => {
    const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
    if (user) {
      setCurrentUser(user)
      await fetchEvents(user.id)  // Pass userId directly
    } else {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }
  loadUserAndEvents()
}, [currentDate])
```

Also updated `fetchEvents` to accept `userId` as a parameter instead of relying on state.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fix 3: Added Debug Tools

Created two debug tools to help diagnose issues:

1. **Browser Debug Page**: `/app/debug/page.tsx`
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/debug` to see real-time auth state
   - Shows session, localStorage, profile data, and more
   - Provides troubleshooting tips

2. **Node.js Debug Script**: `test-auth-debug.js`
   - Run `node test-auth-debug.js your@email.com yourpassword`
   - Tests database connection, user profiles, and auth flow
   - Checks for common issues

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Restart Your Dev Server üîÑ

The code changes require a restart to take effect:

```bash
# Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Your Browser Data üßπ

Your browser might have old session data that's causing conflicts:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab ‚Üí **Local Storage**
3. Find your localhost entry
4. Look for keys starting with `sb-` and delete them
5. Or just click "Clear All" for localhost

**Easier method**: Use Incognito/Private window for a clean test.

### Step 3: Test the Debug Page üîç

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/debug`
2. Review all 5 sections - they should all show ‚úÖ
3. If anything shows ‚ùå, note what it says

### Step 4: Test Sign In Flow üîê

1. Go to the home page and sign out (if shown as logged in)
2. Try signing in with your known credentials
3. Check that:
   - ‚úÖ You stay logged in after page refresh
   - ‚úÖ Calendar loads your events
   - ‚úÖ Profile page shows your info
   - ‚úÖ Maps page works

### Step 5: Check Supabase Dashboard üìä

The username/full_name issue likely stems from the database trigger. Check:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Run this to verify the trigger exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
   ```

3. Check existing users:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, username, full_name, created_at 
   FROM public.users 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. If trigger doesn't exist, run the SQL from:
   `/supabase/create-user-function.sql`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Browser localStorage cleared (or using incognito)
- [ ] Can sign in with correct credentials
- [ ] Session persists after page refresh
- [ ] Calendar page loads events
- [ ] Maps page loads markers
- [ ] Profile page shows user info
- [ ] Debug page shows all green ‚úÖ

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid credentials" on sign in
**Solution**: 
- Password might be different than you think
- Reset password in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
- Or create a new test account

### Issue: Profile page shows "Not Signed In" but you just logged in
**Solution**:
- Clear localStorage and try again
- Check `/debug` page to see session state
- Restart dev server

### Issue: Username/Full Name missing in profile
**Solution**:
- The database trigger isn't working
- Run `/supabase/create-user-function.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- Manually update existing users:
  ```sql
  UPDATE public.users 
  SET username = 'desired_username', 
      full_name = 'Full Name'
  WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
  ```

### Issue: "No new account in Supabase" when signing up
**Solution**:
- This might actually be the old account!
- The trigger is creating the profile with email as username
- Check the auth.users table in Supabase Dashboard
- Your "new" signup might be signing into the existing account

---

## Additional Commands

### Run Node.js debug script:
```bash
node test-auth-debug.js
# Or test specific credentials:
node test-auth-debug.js test@example.com password123
```

### Check what's in localStorage (browser console):
```javascript
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('sb-'))
```

### Force sign out everywhere (browser console):
```javascript
await supabase.auth.signOut()
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

---

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm everything is working:

1. Delete the debug files (optional):
   - `/app/debug/page.tsx`
   - `/test-auth-debug.js`
   - `/AUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

2. Consider adding:
   - Email verification flow
   - Password reset functionality
   - Better error messages in AuthForm
   - Loading states during auth
